Hi! My name is Fifi, I am a third year Materials Engineer and I am running for DPFS. This role requires experience, dedication and trust between the sabbatical officers and you, the students. With 3 years of bar experience, including a year as a manager at Beit Bars, I have valuable knowledge in union finances, events and services at Union outlets, and an unwavering dedication to the student experience. I know what works, what the students want, and how to deliver it.
